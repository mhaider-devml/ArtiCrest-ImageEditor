This repository contains a single page web application built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows users
to upload their own images and edit them using a range of image filters such as saturation, brightness, 
inversion, grayscale, and rotation.

Users can upload their images directly from their devices or through an image URL. They can then apply 
various filters to enhance the look and feel of their images. Additionally, they can flip and rotate the 
image to achieve the desired orientation.

The app also enables users to download the edited image for free, either in its original format or in a 
different image format.

This web application is an excellent tool for graphic designers, photographers, and anyone who needs to 
edit images online. The code is open source and available for anyone to modify and enhance the app further.
